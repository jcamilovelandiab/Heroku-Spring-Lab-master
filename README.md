### What the application do?
  The application offers the API Rest service in which we can perform operations such as get, post, put, and delete on the entities, car    and user.
  
### Describe the REST services exposed by the application.

  The REST services that offers the application:
- With the car controller we can do:
    - view information for all cars from the application.
    - create a car.
    - update car information.
    - delete a car from the application with the license plate.
- With the user controller we can do:
    - view information for all users from the application.
    - create an user.
    - update user information.
    - delete a user from the application with the id.

### For what purpose is the Procfile plaintext file? 

 Heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
 The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named Procfile without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid.  The Procfile must live in your appâ€™s root directory. It does not function if placed anywhere else.
 
 the following line is on our procfile:
 ```sh
web: java -jar target/heroku-lab-1.0.jar.
```
